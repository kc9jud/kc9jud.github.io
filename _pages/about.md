I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame, working in _ab 
initio_ nuclear theory. I'm particularly interested in symmetries in 
nuclear physics, and how complex behaviors emerge from simpler degrees 
of freedom. I'm also focused on applying high-performance 
computing to nuclear structure calculations, where efficient use 
of distributed and heterogeneous architecures is critical.
