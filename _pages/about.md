I'm a postdoctoral associate at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/)
in the [Physics Division](https://www.anl.gov/phy), working in _ab initio_
nuclear theory. I recently defended my Ph.D. in
[physics at the University of Notre Dame](https://nuclear-theory.nd.edu/), where
I worked on chiral effective field theories for nuclear structure and many-body
methods. I'm particularly interested in symmetries in nuclear physics, and how
complex behaviors emerge from simpler degrees of freedom. I'm also focused on
applying high-performance computing to nuclear structure calculations, where
efficient use of distributed and heterogeneous architecures is critical.
