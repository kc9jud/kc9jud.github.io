I'm a Senior HPC Applications Engineer at [NextSilicon](https://www.nextsilicon.com/).
We're building a new type of accelerator for high-performance computing, and I help
people get the best performance possible.

I received my Ph.D. in
[physics at the University of Notre Dame](https://nuclear-theory.nd.edu/), where
I worked on chiral effective field theories for nuclear structure and many-body
methods. I'm particularly interested in symmetries in nuclear physics, and how
complex behaviors emerge from simpler degrees of freedom. I also focused on
applying high-performance computing to nuclear structure calculations, where
efficient use of distributed and heterogeneous architecures is critical.
