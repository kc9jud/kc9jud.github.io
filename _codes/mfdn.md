MFDn is a configuration interaction code for performing no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations for light nuclei using realistic 2-and 3-body interactions. It is an MPI/OpenMP hybrid code with Lanczos and LOBPCG eigensolvers.  It has been extensively optimized for Cori KNL, and is undergoing reimplementation for Permutter GPU.
