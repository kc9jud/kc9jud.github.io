_Ab initio_ no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations for the
nuclear many-body problem have traditionally relied upon an antisymmetrized
product (Slater determinant) basis built from harmonic oscillator orbitals. The
accuracy of such calculations is limited by the finite dimensions which are
computationally feasible for the truncated many-body space. We therefore seek to
improve the accuracy obtained for a given basis size by optimizing the choice of
single-particle orbitals. Natural orbitals, which diagonalize the one-body
density matrix, provide a basis which maximizes the occupation of low-lying
orbitals, thus accelerating convergence in a configuration-interaction basis,
while also possibly providing physical insight into the single-particle
structure of the many-body wave function. We describe the implementation of
natural orbitals in the NCCI framework, and examine the nature of the natural
orbitals thus obtained, the properties of the resulting many-body wave
functions, and the convergence of observables. After taking $^3\mathrm{He}$ as
an illustrative testbed, we explore aspects of NCCI calculations with natural
orbitals for the ground state of the p-shell neutron halo nucleus
$^6\mathrm{He}$.
