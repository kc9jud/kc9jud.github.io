_Ab initio_ theory describes nuclei from a fully microscopic formulation,
with no presupposition of collective degrees of freedom, yet signatures of
clustering and rotation nonetheless arise.
We can therefore look to _ab initio_ theory for an understanding of the
nature of these emergent phenomena.
To probe the nature of rotation in <sup>10</sup>Be,
we examine the predicted rotational spectroscopy from no-core configuration
interaction (NCCI) calculations with the Daejeon16 internucleon interaction,
and find spectra suggestive of coexisting rotational structures having
qualitatively different intrinsic deformations: one triaxial and the other with
large axial deformation arising primarily from the neutrons.
