Meaningful predictions for electric quadrupole ($E2$) observables from ab initio nuclear theory are necessary,
if the _ab initio_ description of collective correlations is to be confronted with experiment, as well as to 
provide predictive power for unknown $E2$ observables. However, converged results for $E2$ observables are notoriously 
challenging to obtain in _ab initio_ no-core configuration interaction approaches. Matrix elements of the $E2$ operator 
are sensitive to the large-distance tails of the nuclear wave function, which converge slowly in an oscillator 
basis expansion. Similar convergence challenges beset _ab initio_ prediction of the nuclear charge radius. We 
demonstrate that the convergence patterns of the $E2$ and radius observables are strongly correlated, and that 
meaningful predictions for the absolute scale of $E2$ observables may be made by calibrating to the experimentally 
known ground-state charge radius. We illustrate by providing robust _ab initio_ predictions for several $E2$ transition 
strengths and quadrupole moments in _p_-shell nuclei, in cases where experimental results are available for comparison.
