A new precision half-life measurement of <sup>13</sup>N has been conducted using
the TwinSol &beta;-counting station at the University of Notre Dame. The
measured value of <span style="white-space: nowrap"><i>t</i><span
class="supsub"><sup>new</sup><sub>1/2</sub></span>=597.05(19) s</span> differs
from the previous world value by about 2.8&sigma;. An evaluation of the
<sup>13</sup>N half-life results in a <span style="white-space:
nowrap"><i>t</i><span
class="supsub"><sup>world</sup><sub>1/2</sub></span>=597.19(22) s</span>.
Updated standard model predictions for the Fermi to Gamow-Teller mixing ratio
&rho; and its associated correlation parameters have been calculated using the
new <sup>13</sup>N world half-life in preparation for a future measurement of
the mixing ratio. Finally, an ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI)
calculation for the $B(GT)$ of this decay, carried out using the Daejeon16
interaction, has been performed, revealing the need for higher-order chiral
corrections.
