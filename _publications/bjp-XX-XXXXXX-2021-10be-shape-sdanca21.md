Within the low-lying spectrum of $^{10}\mathrm{Be}$, multiple rotational bands
are found, with strikingly different moments of inertia. A proposed
interpretation has been that these bands variously represent triaxial rotation
and prolate axially-deformed rotation. The bands are well-reproduced in ab
initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations. We use the
calculated wave functions to elucidate the nuclear shapes underlying these
bands, by examining the Elliott $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry content of these wave functions.
The ab initio results support an interpretation in which the ground-state band,
along with an accompanying $K=2$ side band, represent a triaxial rotor, arising
from an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ irreducible representation in the $0\hbar\omega$ space. Then, the
lowest excited $K=0$ band represents a prolate rotor, arising from an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$
irreducible representation in the $2\hbar\omega$ space.
