For electric quadrupole ($E2$) observables, which depend on the large-distance
tails of the nuclear wave function, _ab initio_ no-core configuration
interaction (NCCI) calculations converge slowly, making meaningful predictions
challenging to obtain. Nonetheless, the calculated values for different $E2$
matrix elements, particularly those involving levels with closely-related
structure (_e.g._, within the same rotational band) are found to be
robustly proportinal.  This observation suggests that a known value for one
observable may be used to determine the overall scale of $E2$ strengths, and
thereby provide predictions for others. In particular, we demonstrate that
meaningful predictions for $E2$ transitions may obtained by calibration to the
ground-state quadrupole moment. We test this approach for well-measured
low-lying $E2$ transitions in <sup>7</sup>Li and <sup>9</sup>Be, then
provide predictions for transitions in <sup>8,9</sup>Li.  In particular, we
address the $2^+\rightarrow1^+$ transition in <sup>8</sup>Li, for which the
reported measured strength exceeds _ab initio_ Green's function Monte
Carlo (GFMC) predictions by over an order of magnitude.
