The spectrum of <sup>12</sup>Be exhibits exotic features, _e.g._, an intruder ground state and shape coexistence,
normally associated with the breakdown of a shell closure. While previous phenomenological treatments indicated
the ground state has substantial contributions from intruder configurations, it is only with advances in computational
abilities and improved interactions that this intruder mixing is observed in _ab initio_ no-core shell model (NCSM)
predictions. In this work, we extract electromagnetic observables and symmetry decompositions from the NCSM wave
functions to demonstrate that the low-lying positive parity spectrum can be explained in terms of mixing of rotational
bands with very different intrinsic structure coexisting within the low-lying spectrum. These observed bands exhibit
an approximate $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry and are qualitatively consistent with Elliott model predictions.
